  The DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm is a symmetric-key block cipher
  created by an IBM team and adopted by the National Institute of Standards and
  Technology (NIST). The algorithm takes the plain text in 64-bit blocks and
  converts them into ciphertext using 48-bit keys.<br /><br />
  Since itâ€™s a symmetric-key algorithm, it employs the same key in both
  encrypting and decrypting the data. If it were an asymmetrical algorithm, it
  would use different keys for encryption and decryption.<br /><br />
  DES is based on the Feistel block cipher, called LUCIFER, developed in by IBM
  cryptography researcher Horst Feistel. DES uses 16 rounds of the Feistel
  structure, using a different key for each round.<br /><br />
